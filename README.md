## Features
- **Link Management**: The application allows you to create, update, and delete links. Each link has associated metadata such as title, URL, content summary, and creation/update timestamps.
- **Content Scraping**: The application uses a web scraper (powered by Cheerio) to fetch and extract the main content from external websites.
- **Content Summarization**: The application uses the Google Generative AI to generate a concise summary of the scraped content.
- **User Settings**: Users can customize the application's behavior, such as the API key for the Google Generative AI.

## Architecture
The Link Manager application is built using the following components:

### UI Components
The UI Components are responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. They include the following components:
- `LandingPage`: The landing page of the application.
- `DashboardPage`: The main page where users can manage their links.
- `SettingsPage`: The page where users can configure their settings.
- `Layout`: The layout component that wraps the main pages.

### Global State Management (zustand)
The Global State Management component is responsible for managing the application's state, including links, content summaries, and user settings. It uses the `zustand` library to manage the state.

### Scraper (cheerio)
The Scraper component is responsible for fetching and extracting the main content from external websites. It uses the `cheerio` library to parse the HTML and extract the relevant content.

### AI Summarizer (Google Generative AI)
The AI Summarizer component is responsible for generating a concise summary of the scraped content. It uses the Google Generative AI API to generate the summary.

### Utilities
The Utilities component includes various helper functions and services, such as the `UserSettings` service, which manages the user's API key for the Google Generative AI.
